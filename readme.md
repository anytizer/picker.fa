## Story

While FontAwesome provides its own icon picker, navigating to different pages per icon is tedious.
The application is a single page interfcace to search, click and paste the corresponding icon HTML.
The search box provides a common location to find icons.
AngularJS provides the navigation, narrows down the search list.
And a simple javascript copies the corresponding html into clipboard.

So,

**Search, Click, Paste**! Done.


## Platforms used

 * AngularJS based searching of icons.

## Resources

## Disclaimer

 * The purpose is to inspire usage of FontAwesome, not to reduce the page impressions in original website, in order to pick up the icons.
